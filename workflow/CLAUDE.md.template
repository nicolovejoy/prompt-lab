# Output Preferences

- Be concise and direct. No flattery.
- Only offer opinions when code is problematic or a simpler approach exists
- Ask for clarification when intentions are unclear
- Avoid markdown tables in terminal output — use lists or plain text
- Flag when a request seems ill-advised

# Workflow

- Plan before coding. Confirm approach before implementation.
- Work iteratively: one feature at a time, test before moving on.
- Log work to devlog.md using /handoff at session end

# Session Management

- Start sessions with /readup
- End sessions with /handoff

# Prompt History

SQLite database at `~/.claude/prompt-history.db` tracks:
- **prompts**: Auto-logged via hook, rated at /handoff (utility 1-5, tags)
- **commits**: Git commits linked to sessions
- **sessions**: Session start/end times per project

Hook at `~/.claude/hooks/log-prompt.sh` auto-captures all prompts.
/handoff shows unrated prompts for optional rating.
/readup surfaces high-utility (4+) prompts from past sessions.
/prompts queries history (filters: project, `rated`, `tag:<name>`).
